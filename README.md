The project will be organized by the students names, courses that the student is taking, the degree plan of
each student and the project will include a table where it shows the information that is organized to make it
more simple and understandable.
I will create a menu in C++ that has options to select about information, like for example, the student
information, courses information, degree plan of each student. And then it will shows a table where it will
has a connection with each class, like the student class, courses class, Degree plan class, and the schedule
class.

The data related with the program is the Student, Class, Semester Schedule and degree plan, it will need
classes that can be related to get the information together and the end to show in a table the information
that you are searching for.
